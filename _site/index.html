<p><strong><a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/">The Brain Tumour Charity</a></strong> is the world’s leading brain tumour charity and the largest dedicated funder of research into brain tumours globally.</p>

<p>Many of us have family, friends or colleagues that have been affected by brain tumours. What better way to raise money for this worthy cause than spending the weekend of May 25th/26th walking the 27 mile STOOP amongst friends.</p>

<p>The STOOP or the <strong><a href="https://nhrg.org.uk/stoop-stevenage-outer-orbital-path.html">Stevenage Outer Orbital Path</a></strong> is an approximately 27 mile series of linked paths forming a circle surrounding Stevenage. It passes through pretty villages, past some lovely pubs, and meanders alongside streams and hedgerows.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/brokensealtap/">Broken Seal walkers</a></strong> are a group that regularly walks in the countryside around Stevenage and mostly met in the Stevenage Old Town taproom of the same name.</p>

<h2 id="itinerary-and-logistics">Itinerary and Logistics</h2>

<p>The walk will be split into two days of roughly equal length and each day then split into two halves. Joining us for both days, one day or a part of a day would be amazing. Included below is a map of the route from the North Herts Ramblers’ <strong><a href="https://nhrg.org.uk/stoop-stevenage-outer-orbital-path/15-stoop/31-stoop-outline.html">great overview</a></strong>. We will have a few OS explorer route maps available so we don’t need to travel as one large group.</p>

<p>This page will be updated with more information including exact coordinates of start and end points and map details nearer the event.</p>

<p>Clearly the wilds of Stevenage are not, ahem, that wild… Even so, it is a good idea to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wear appropriate footwear and clothing. Waterproofs are definitely a good idea as are layers. It could be wet and windy; equally given the time of year it could be baking hot.</li>
  <li>Sunscreen</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Snacks</li>
  <li>Lunch if you are planning on joining for the full day (definitely bring food, a sugar crash after 7 miles makes the next 7 no fun at all!)</li>
</ul>
